```java

- **Controllers** handle HTTP requests and security
- **DAO Interfaces** define application behavior
- **MySQL DAOs** contain SQL and database logic
- **Models** represent application data only

This structure keeps responsibilities clearly separated and the codebase easy to maintain.

## 🌐 Example API Routes

GET /categories
GET /products
GET /products?cat=1&minPrice=10
GET /cart
POST /cart/products/{id}
PUT /cart/products/{id}
POST /orders
GET /profile
PUT /profile

```

## 🧩 Interesting Code Example

Add Code Picture--

### 🔐 Security Highlights
Authentication required for carts, checkout, and profiles

Admin role required for product and category management

User identity is derived from the authentication context

User IDs are never accepted directly from client requests
